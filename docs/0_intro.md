# Introduction

The `pfsspec-stellar` package provides functionality for simulating and processing stellar spectra. The main features of the package are as follows:

* Data structures to store stellar spectra in HDF5 format
    * Stellar-spectrum specific implementations of datasets and synthetic spectrum grids
* Continuum modelling, fitting and normalization
* Template fitting
    * RV only or physical parameters as well
    * Flux-correction to match observed spectra
    * Fitting continuum normalized templates
